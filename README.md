# C-ASCII-SQUARE-PATTERN

<PRE>

Is a program in which from the given square matrix size a square pattern of n // 2 (rounded up) layers is created with each layer following the chosen pattern if it is in the script that has modes, or in the script base produces an alphabetical sequence by the layers.

Genesis is the basis, the main logic.

PlayMode has the same logic, but with some improvements.

Ex:

Number mode:

1 = 0

0

2 = 0 0 | 0 0

0  0
0  0

3 = 0 0 0 | 0 1 0 | 0 0 0

0  0  0
0  1  0
0  0  0

4 = 0 0 0 0 | 0 1 1 0 | 0 1 1 0 | 0 0 0 0

0  0  0  0
0  1  1  0
0  1  1  0
0  0  0  0

5 = 0 0 0 0 0 | 0 1 1 1 0 | 0 1 2 1 0 | 0 1 1 1 0 | 0 0 0 0 0

0  0  0  0  0
0  1  1  1  0
0  1  2  1  0
0  1  1  1  0
0  0  0  0  0

6 = 0 0 0 0 0 0 | 0 1 1 1 1 0 | 0 1 2 2 1 0 | 0 1 2 2 1 0 | 0 1 1 1 1 0 | 0 0 0 0 0 0

0  0  0  0  0  0
0  1  1  1  1  0
0  1  2  2  1  0
0  1  2  2  1  0
0  1  1  1  1  0
0  0  0  0  0  0

7 = 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 | 0 1 2 2 2 1 0 | 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 | 0 1 2 2 2 1 0 | 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
